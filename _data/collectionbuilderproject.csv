coll001,objects/IMG_4820,,,Al-Mansuri 1,"Rāzī, Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakarīyā",1388,"The Al Mansuri is written in Hebrew. The margins are large and showcase boarder art. The boarder art is a drawing of three four-legged animals, possibly dogs. The three animals are seemingly linked together by a string. The drawing also contains a long rope-like piece with seemingly scalloped edges. One thing to note about this page is that the drawing is much more faint than the writing. Becasue of this the writing is emphasized, and it draws the viewer's attention. In the writing there are a few designs that grab the viewers attention. The designs are very detailed, and they surround text that is large and bold. This seems to indicate that this particular part of the text is important.",Review of Medicine,Portugal,39.77574789,-8.930816952,University of Alabama at Birmingham Archives,,Image;StillImage,jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/
coll002,objects/IMG_4821,,,Al-Mansuri 2 ,"Rāzī, Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakarīyā",1388,"This page also contains many works of art. Like the previous page, there is an extremely design in the center that outlines a little bit of the text. The art is bold and big, and it contains multiple inter-weaving lines. The text that art surrounds is larger than the other parts of the text, and it is written in a more stylized way. Once again, this draws the attention of the reader. The color red is used on this page, and it is largely noticeable. Deriving form the edges of the design in the middle are two dragon-like creatures. These are drawn slightly bolder that the animlas on the previous page, but they are still fainter than the writing. Red is used for the tongues. The tails of the dragons seem to be wrapped around two spears. This could show the power of the dragons.",Review of Medicine,Portugal,39.77574789,-8.930816952,University of Alabama at Birmingham Archives,,Image;StillImage,jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/
coll003,objects/IMG_4822,,,Al-Mansuri 3,"Rāzī, Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakarīyā",1388,"Once again, this page features bold writing with artistic design surrounding it. Drawing the eye of the reader are two words at the center of the page. Bordering the words is a another deatiled design with intertwining minuscule lines that form swirly shapes. This page also includes more artwork in the margins. Off to the right side is a long drawing of another rope-like object. This drawing seems to be just a design. In the center of the drawing are two lines twisted together. The lines are in between several circular, swirly designs that look almost like eyes. At the end, the design has leaf-like lines that flare out from the bottom. This drawing is also in fainter print then the text. The text is more important than the design.",Review of Medicine,Portugal,39.77574789,-8.930816952,University of Alabama at Birmingham Archives,,Image;StillImage,jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/
coll004,objects/IMG_4823,,,Al-Mansuri 4,"Rāzī, Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakarīyā",1388,"This page is unlike the other pages shown thus far. Instead of designs and art, this page focuses on text alone. The typical central text is normal, with no parts bolder and bigger than others. There is no art in the margins, but there is more text. This text is larger than the text in the center of the page, but it is not as bold. The ink doesn't seem to be the same. The writing looks like it could be notes or footnotes. Other than this writing, this page is relatively bare.",Review of Medicine,Portugal,39.77574789,-8.930816952,University of Alabama at Birmingham Archives,,Image;StillImage,jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/
coll005,objects/IMG_4824,,,Al-Mansuri 5,"Rāzī, Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakarīyā",1388,"This page is also different from the previous ones. The most noticeable thing about this page is the bright red art in the center. This art surrounds more bold words in the center of the page. The design of this art is similar to that of other pages, but it contains more floral details. At the two right corners of the design spring two plants, probably flowers. Another thing to note about this page is that at the top and the bottom of the text are words that are large and bold. They are not surrounded by designs to draw the audience's attention. They are most likely in bold to place emphasis on the words and show their importance.",Review of Medicine,Portugal,39.77574789,-8.930816952,University of Alabama at Birmingham Archives,,Image;StillImage,jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/
